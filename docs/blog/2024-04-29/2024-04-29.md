## Introduction
We had a bunch of releases today which will help you be more effective and also to integrate AskUI better in your current toolchain.

Our docs lacked a comprehensive source of common challenges about detecting elements and how to address them. Thus we created a [Recommended Practices page](https://docs.askui.com/docs/next/general/Element%20Selection/recommended-practices) and a separate [Custom Elements page](https://docs.askui.com/docs/next/general/Element%20Selection/custom-elements). Let us know if something is missing!

We were also able to release more Convenience methods in this version. They are more expressive and also shorter to write. Read about them below and also how to migrate to the new syntax for `clickText()` and `clickButton()`.

Speaking of convenience: We also added an _ESLint_ rule that checks for the correct usage of `expect()`.

Last but not least we fixed a bug in our test environment implementation `@askui/jest-allure-circus`. It is now compatible with `jest-cucumber`. ([Link to accompanying blog](https://www.askui.com/blog-posts/use-askui-and-cucumber-together)).

## Breaking Changes

- Method signature changed for `clickText()`. [API docs](https://docs.askui.com/docs/next/api/Convenience/clicktext)

```typescript
// Before
await aui.clickText('Hello World');

// Now
await aui.clickText({text: 'Hello World', type: 'similar'});
```

- Method signature changed for `clickButton()`. [API docs](https://docs.askui.com/docs/next/api/Convenience/clickbutton)

```typescript

// Before
await aui.click().button().withText('Submit').exec();

// Now
await aui.clickButton({label: 'Submit'});
```

## New Features
New Convenience methods added to AskUI TypeScript SDK:

- [clickCheckbox()](https://docs.askui.com/docs/next/api/Convenience/clickcheckbox)
- [clickSwitch()](https://docs.askui.com/docs/next/api/Convenience/clickswitch)
- [typeIntoTextfield()](https://docs.askui.com/docs/next/api/Convenience/typeintotextfield)

We expanded our npm package [@askui/eslint-plugin-askui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@askui/eslint-plugin-askui) with a new rule that checks for the correct usage of `expect()``

- Upgrade the plugin to `1.3.0`
- Add the following rule: `"@askui/askui/expect": "error"`
- Check the [README for a complete guide](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@askui/eslint-plugin-askui)

## Fixes

- `@askui/jest-allure-circus` accepts the `testEnvironmentOptions` `addCodeInReport` now
  - Upgrade the dependency to version `1.0.23`

```typescript
// Usage
const config: Config.InitialOptions = {
  ...
  testEnvironment: '@askui/jest-allure-circus',
  testEnvironmentOptions: {
    addCodeInReport: false
  },
};
...
```
