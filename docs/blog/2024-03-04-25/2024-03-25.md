## Introduction
This week we introduced a new convenience method `clickTextfieldNearestTo(label: string)` which lets you click on a textfield with a label instead of a placeholder.

We also removed the convenience method `dragTo` as it was not working as intended.

There is a new option `-ad --automations-description` for initialising an AskUI project with `npx askui@latest init`. It lets you specify the name of the automations directory which was hardcoded to `askui_example` before.

## Convenience Methods
We had to remove `dragTo()` as it was not working as expected

We introduced the following method:

### `clickTextfieldNearestTo(label: string)`
Searches for an element of type textfield with a specific label nearest to it. If found, clicks it.

```typescript
await aui.clickTextfieldNearestTo('E-Mail Address');
```

## New Option `-ad --automations-description` for `init`
When you run `npx askui@latest init` you always got a directory `askui_example`. This broke backwards compatibility with existing installations of AskUI.

Thus we introduced a new option when running `askui init`:

```sh
-ad, --automations-directory <value>  a name for the directory askui stores its configuration and workflows in. (default: "askui_example")
```

You can use it like this to store the AskUI automations in a directory `askui-Workflows`:

```sh
npx askui@latest init -ad askui-Workflows
```
